# Localization Process of Satellite Integrated with GSM for Enhanced Positioning Services
This paper presents a hybrid localization system combining satellite and GSM networks to improve positioning where GPS is weak or unavailable. Using time-of-arrival measurements and interference management in shared spectrum, the approach achieves up to 50% better accuracy than standalone systems and discusses related technical, regulatory, and future research challenges.
